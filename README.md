# I write this because i am wonder about skill test from Kompas

# When i google for this, i found many ways to solve this task
# I said, "It must be easy for every one because there is a lot of reference from internet"
# After a little more pay attantion, it has a challenge
# The triangle must look like a sand watch with a signature

# It simultance when my mac got booting error after it doing some auto updated
# I think it died. Fortunately, i have Windows OS installed in another partition
# I use this to make sure my mac doesnt have some hardware trouble. Yeay! it boot on Windows!
# So i decided, oke this time to upgrate to el capiten from yosemite

# re-install python3 using brew
# install pycharm -> tools matters, they said. TRUE
# and.. this is it! :)
